# Shortr

An example URL shortener Phoenix app.

## Features

- Generate a CUID for the "short" hash (not as short as it could be but does the job)
- Single page feel built using Live View
- Tracks visits to URLs
- Simple auth

## TODO

- [ ] Deploy to demo URL and allow limited usage (30 links?)
- [ ] Make a graph from visit data

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
